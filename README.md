My name Jannes, born and raised in Berlin, Germany. I love coding, fine tuning DevOps infrastracture, helping people in digital questions (a.k.a consulting) and delivering 
satisfying digital solutions. What else? Traveling, financial knowledge, going boating, movies (tendency to psycho-thriller and comedy), books and setting a goal on keeping myself healthy.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Master Degree (focus on DevOps, e-business and requirements engineering)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning VueJS, advanced Docker usage and Haskell
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything that might came up to your mind
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mail@jannesbrunner.de

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've spent way to much time for this section and ended up with nothing funny to display BUT I consider myself as very funny :)
